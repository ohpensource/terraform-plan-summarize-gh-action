## code-of-conduct

Go crazy on the pull requests :) ! The only requirements are:

> - Use _conventional-commits_.
> - Include _jira-tickets_ in your commits.
> - Create/Update the documentation of the use case you are creating, improving or fixing. **[Boy scout](https://biratkirat.medium.com/step-8-the-boy-scout-rule-robert-c-martin-uncle-bob-9ac839778385) rules apply**. That means, for example, if you fix an already existing workflow, please include the necessary documentation to help everybody. The rule of thumb is: _leave the place (just a little bit)better than when you came_.
